Design a scheduling program to implem ents a Queue with two levels: Level 1 : Fixed priority preemptive Scheduling Level 2 : Round Robin Scheduling For  a  Fixed  priority  preemptive  Scheduling  (Queue  1),  the  Priority  0  is  highest  priority.  If  one process P1 is scheduled  and running ,  another process P2 with higher priority  comes. The Newprocess (high priority) process P2 preempts currently running process P1 and process P1 will goto  second  level  queue.  Time  for  which  process  will  strictly  execute  must  be  considered  in  the multiples of 2.. All  the  processes  in  second  level  queue  will  complete  their  execution  according  to  round  robin scheduling.
